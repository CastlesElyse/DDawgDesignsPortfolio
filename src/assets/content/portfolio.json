At a whopping 40 pages, this is my largest magazine project to date! I am also very proud of this project because it marked a shift in my mindset for magazine production, trying to replicate the feel of a collegiate publication more so than my previous works. I not only designed this whole magazine, but also contributed my writing skills to several articles.",

As our “Back to School Edition”, it features several articles that update students, alumni, and friends about what Saint Joseph High School had planned for the new year.",

The Viewbook serves the purpose of being the main printed source of information for prospective families. It walks families through the ins and outs of what makes Saint Joseph High School a unique experience and the offerings that are in store. Compared to the TODAY Magazine and Annual Reports, it is more of a sales piece than a traditional article based magazine. I had to take this all into consideration when deciding on which spreads to update from previous years and which ones to recreate entirely.",

In college I had primarily thought of myself as a video editor, but when I joined Saint Joseph High School’s Communications and Marketing team, I was given the opportunity to design all their magazine publications and I fell in love with print media. This first edition presented me with many challenges to overcome, especially having only worked briefly with magazines when I took an elective at RIT dedicated to them. Looking back there are many things I would do differently, but I learned more from this project than potentially anything else I have worked on.",
