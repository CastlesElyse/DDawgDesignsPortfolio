At a whopping 40 pages, this is my largest magazine project to date! I am also very proud of this project because it marked a shift in my mindset for magazine production, trying to replicate the feel of a collegiate publication more so than my previous works. I not only designed this whole magazine, but also contributed my writing skills to several articles.",
