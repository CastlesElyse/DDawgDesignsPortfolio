                "description": "The 2022 Annual Report is a larger-scale magazine that incorporates both the traditional article format, as well as donor information, statistics, and infographics. At a whopping 40 pages, this is my largest magazine project to date! I am also very proud of this project because it marked a shift in my mindset for magazine production, trying to replicate the feel of a collegiate publication more so than my previous works. I not only designed this whole magazine, but also contributed my writing skills to several articles.",

                "description": "Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of 'de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum' (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..', comes from a line in section 1.10.32.",
